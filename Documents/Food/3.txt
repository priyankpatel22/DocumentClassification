Jameson Fink's Tasting Notes:

Ah, my trusted winter companion during the January I spent living and volunteering at Finnriver Farm. This wine reminds me a lot of white Port. It has similar potency, just not made from grapes. I actually find it to be quite dry, but there is a touch of sweetness. And, like white Port, totally underrated when it comes to summer refreshment. Sure, sip on a small glass in winter in front of the fire, or in a cabin on an Olympic Peninsula organic family farm. But when it comes to summer fill a tall glass with ice, add a couple shots of Spirited Apple Wine, top with club soda, a squeeze of lime to finish. (You could even experiment with adding some mint or basil, too.)
