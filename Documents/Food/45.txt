Abstract: Fruit size and shape are the most important quality parameters. Moreover, misshapen fruits are
usually rejected according to sorting standards. This study was conducted to determine quantitative
classification algorithm for apple size and shape. To reach objective and reproducible results, mass and outer
dimensions (height and diameter) of apple were measured and an assessment based on mass and outer
dimensions was proposed. Results of the study showed that mass and aspect ratio (height to diameter ratio)
of apple can be used successfully to classify apple size and shape.

apples of various sizes were purchased from an orchard
located in Damavand, Iran. Apples were selected for
defects by careful visual inspection, transferred to the
laboratory and held at 5±1 C and 90±5% relative humidity
until experimental procedure. In order to obtain required
parameters for apple size and shape detection algorithm,
the mass of each apple was measured to 1.0 g accuracy on
a digital balance. By assuming the general shape of apple
as an oblate spheroid, the outer dimensions of each apple,
i.e. height (H) and diameter (D) was measured to 0.1 cm
accuracy by a digital caliper. Table 1 shows some physical
and geometrical properties of the 115 randomly selected
apples.
Size Detection: Primary investigation indicated that three
apple sizes, i.e. small (misshapen), medium (normal) and
large (normal) were detectable and separable in the
samples.
Shape Detection: An easy technique of judging based on
analysis of outer dimensions of apple was used for
detecting shape of apple. Aspect ratio was used to detect
oblate spheroid (misshapen), spheroid (normal) and
oblong spheroid (misshapen) apples. Aspect ratio is
defined by equation 1 [4-6, 12].
A.R. = H / D, (A.R. = 1.0) (1)
Where:
A.R. = Aspect ratio, dimensionless
H = Height of apple, cm
D = Diameter of apple, cm
For mathematical describing of apple size and shape,
mass and aspect ratio of apples were subjected to
statistical analysis using the Microsoft Office Excel
(Version 7.0 - 2003).
RESULTS
Small, Medium and Large Sizes: Mass of medium size
apples ranged from 100 g to 140 g, while mass of small size
apples were less than or equal to 100 g and mass of large
size apples were more than or equal to 140 g. Therefore,
the mass lines 100 g and 140 g can separate medium size
apples from small size and large size apples as shown in
Fig. 2.
Oblate Spheroid, Spheroid and Oblong Spheroid Shapes:
Aspect ratio of spheroid shape apples ranged from 0.95 to
1.05, while aspect ratio of oblong spheroid shape apples
were more than or equal to 1.05 and aspect ratio of oblate
shape apples were less than or equal to 0.95. As a result,
the aspect ratio lines 0.95 and 1.05 can separate spheroid
shape apples from oblate spheroid shape and oblong
spheroid shape apples as indicated in Fig. 2.
Normal and Misshapen Apples: Among nine “size and
shape” combinations (three sizes × three shapes);
samples with “normal size” × “normal shape” (two
combinations) were considered as normal apples. Apples
with other combinations (seven combinations) were
considered as misshapen apples. Fig. 2 shows the mass
lines 100 g and 140 g in association with the aspect ratio
lines 0.95 and 1.05 can separate normal apples (two green
regions) from misshapen apples (seven white regions).
DISCUSSION
In this study, mass and outer dimensions (height and
diameter) of apples were analyzed to classify apples size
and shape. Results of study indicated that three sizes,
three shapes and consequently nine “size and shape”
combinations were detectable and separable in the apples.
Results of study also showed that among three sizes,
frequency of medium apples was the highest (60.8%),
while frequency of small apples was the lowest (17.4%).Am-Euras. J. Agric. & Environ. Sci., 9 (6): 618-621, 2010

Frequency of large apples was 21.8%. Besides, among
three shapes, frequency of spheroid apples was the
highest (66.0%), while frequency of oblong spheroid
apples was the lowest (12.2%). Frequency of oblate
spheroid apples was 21.8%. Moreover, frequencies of
normal and misshapen apples were 54.7% and 45.3%,
respectively (Table 2). These results are in agreement with
those of Rashidi & Seyfi [4], Rashidi & Gholami [5] and
Sadrnia et al. [6] who concluded that physical and
geometrical properties of fruit can be used to determine
normal and misshapen fruit.
CONCLUSION
It can be concluded that mass and aspect ratio of
apple can be used to classify normal and misshapen
apple.
