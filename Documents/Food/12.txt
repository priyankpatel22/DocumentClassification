Ever wish you could have an apple orchard in your backyard? You can—in the space of a single tree—if you plant a hedge of dwarf apple trees or an apple espalier.

To get started, let's talk about selection criteria first:

Look for disease-resistant trees that give you the ability to grow organic fruit or to use fewer chemicals. Maintenance is easier, too.
You need to choose a rootstock. All apple trees sold have 2 parts: a "rootstock" or foundation and a "scion" or top portion which determines the fruit variety. A rootstock can be a seeding (which produces a full-size tree) or it can be "dwarfing" or "size-controlling" (which produces a smaller tree for easier care and harvest).  
For dwarf trees, make sure that the rootstock is specified. A Bud 9 is a common, hardy tree that's easy to train for USDA Climate Zones 3 to 5. The M9 is probably the most widely planted rootstock, though it would die in frigid winters.
Buy dormant, bare-root, 1-year-old nursery trees with good root systems. Dwarfs and semidwarfs will bear in 3 to 4 years, yielding 1 to 2 bushels per year. Standard-size trees will bear in 5 to 8 years, yielding 4 to 5 bushels of apples per year.
The variety of apple selected should be based on fruit characteristics, bloom time and pollen compatibility. Consult a local nursery to see which trees are potential cross-pollinators in your area. For best results, include a 'Grimes Golden', 'Golden Delicious', 'Red Delicious', or 'Winter Banana' in your planting. These varieties are known pollinators. Crabapple trees can also be used as pollinizers if they bloom at the same time as the desired variety. Nursery catalogs will provide pollination charts.
Most apple varieties do not pollinate themselves or any flowers of the same apple vareity; this requires planting at least two different apple tree varieties close to one another so that the bees can pollinate. (There are actually some self-pollinating apple tree varieties if you are really short on space. See list of self-fertile apples. However, even these apple trees will bear more fruit if cross-pollinated.)

 
Planting
Spring planting is recommended in central and northern areas. Where fall and winter weather is generally mild and moist, fall planting is successful.
Climate Considerations
Not every apple grows everywhere. Each variety has a specific number of days needed for fruit maturity.
Tree tags don't always tell you where the variety grows best, but many catalogs do. Also, check with your county extension agent for a specific recommendation for your area.
As a general rule, if a tree is termed hardy, it grows best in Zones 3 to 5. If termed long-season, apple quality will be best in Zones 5 to 8. Check your zone here.
Each variety has a number of chill hours needed to set fruit (i.e., the amount of time temperatures are between 32 and 45 degrees F). The farther north you go, the more chill hours an apple variety needs to avoid late spring freeze problems. Check tree tags for chill hour information or ask the seller.
Site and Soil
Take a soil test prior to planting your apple trees. Your local County Extension Center can instruct you in collecting the soil sample, help you interpret the results, and provide valuable information about the soil in your county. Results from the soil test will determine the soil amendments necessary to correct nutrient deficiencies and adjust soil pH. The amendments should be worked into the soil to a depth of 12 to 18 inches where the tree will root, not just the planting hole. 

Apple trees need well-drained soil, not too wet. Soil needs to be moderately rich and retain moisture as well as air; mulch with straw, hay, or some other organic material to keep soil moist and provide nutrients as they decompose. 

Choose a sunny site. For best fruiting, an apple tree needs "full sunlight," which means six or more hours of direct summer sun daily. The best exposure for apples is a north- or east-facing slope.

Tree spacing is influenced by the rootstock, soil fertility, and pruning. A seedling or full-size tree should be planted about 15 to 18 feet in a row. A dwarfing rootstock might be 4 to 8 feet in a row.

Dwarf apple trees are notoriously prone to uprooting under the weight of a heavy crop, so you should provide a support system for your hedge. You can grow your trees against a fence, or you can provide free-standing support in the form of a trellis.

Make sure the tree will not be planted in a "frost pocket" where cold air settles in low-lying areas. Choose a higher site with a slip if possible so that cold air will flow away from the trees.
 
Do not plant trees near wooded areas or trees. 
Planting the Tree in the Ground
 
Before planting, remove all weeds and the grass in a 4-foot diameter circle. 
 
After you purchase the tree, protect it from injury, drying out, freezing, or overheating. If the roots have dried out, soak them in water about 24 hours before planting.
 
Dig a hole approximately twice the diameter of the root system and 2 feet deep. Place some of the loose soil back into the hole and loosen the soil on the walls of the planting hole so the roots can easily penetrate the soil. Spread the tree roots on the loose soil, making sure they are not twisted or crowded in the hole. Continue to replace soil around the roots. As you begin to cover the roots, firm the soil to be sure it surrounds the roots and to remove air pockets.
Do not add fertilizer at planting time as the roots can be "burned". Fill the remainder of the hole with the loose soil, and press the soil down well.
 
The graft union must be at least 2 inches above the soil line so that roots do not emerge from the scion. When you have finished planting the tree, water well to eliminate air pockets and provide good contact between the roots and the soil.
Care
Minimize Pruning of a Young Tree
Pruning slows a young tree's overall growth and can delay fruiting, so don't be in a hurry to prune, other than removing misplaced, broken, or dead branches. There are several techniques to direct growth without heavy pruning. For example:

Rub off misplaced buds before they grow into misplaced branches.
Bend a stem down almost horizontally for a few weeks to slow growth and promote branches and fruiting. Tie down with strings to stakes in the ground or to lower branches.
Prune a Mature Tree Annually
Once an apple tree has filled in and is bearing fruit, it requires regular, moderate pruning.

Prune your mature tree when it is dormant. Completely cut away overly vigorous, upright stems (most common high up in the tree).
Remove weak twigs (which often hang from the undersides of limbs.
Shorten stems that become too droopy, especially those low in the tree.
After about ten years, fruiting spurs (stubby branches that elongate only about a half-inch per year) become overcrowded and decrepit. Cut away some of them and shorten others.
When a whole limb of fruiting spurs declines with age, cut it back to make room for a younger replacement.
Thin Ruthlessly
Thin or remove excess fruit. This seems hard but this practice evens out production, prevents a heavy crop from breaking limbs, and ensures better-tasting, larger fruit crop.
Soon after fruit-set, remove the smallest fruits or damaged ones,leaving four inches between those that remain.
Pests
Apples are prone to pests. Here are some pointers:

Keep deer at bay with repellents or fencing; deter mice and rabbits with wire-mesh cylinders around the base of the tree.
Sprays may be needed for insects, although one of the worst culprits, the apple maggot, can be trapped simply enough by hanging one or two round, softball-size balls, painted red and coated with sticky "Tangle-Trap," from a branch in June through the summer. Reapply the sticky goo a time or two, as necessary.
Fend off diseases by raking apple leaves, burying them beneath mulch, or grinding them with a lawn mower at season's end.
Pruning reduces disease by letting in more light and air.
Harvest/Storage
Harvest Patiently. After all this pruning and caring, be sure to harvest your apples at their peak of perfection.

Pluck your apples when their background color is no longer green.
Different apple varieties mature at different times, so the harvest season can stretch from August to October.
At this point, the stem should part readily from the branch when the fruit is cupped in the palm of your hand and given a slight twist around, then up.
If the apple is overripe and soft, use for cooking!
Apples keep well for about six months at temperatures between 32 and 45 degrees F.
"Baked apples have an excellent effect upon the whole physical system, feeding the brain as well as adding to the flesh, and keeping the blood pure; also preventing constipation and correcting a tendency to acidity, which produces rheumatism and neuralgia." –A Tip from The 1898 Old Farmer's Almanac

Recommended Varieties
Beyond climate considerations, how will you use your apples? Do you love to bake apple pies? Or, perhaps you just want apples that taste far better than what you could buy in a grocery store.

A young dwarf tree produces about 1 1/2 bushels of fruit—and even less when the tree is part of an apple hedge. So, if you're interested in baking lots of 'Cox's Orange Pippin' apple pies, you'll need to plant several trees of that variety to get enough fruit.
If you have no particular culinary goal, try planting one each of different varieties that ripen over the entire harvest season. Then you can enjoy regular apple tastings and still have enough fruit on hand for a "mess" of cooked apples.
Plant disease-resistant apple varieties such as 'Liberty', 'Jonafree', 'Macfree', and 'Williams Pride'.
Seek out the advice of local orchardists about the varieties that will do well in your area. Do the bulk of your planning from an easy chair, with a half-dozen nursery catalogs in your lap!

Hi Joyce,
When did you plant the trees? If they were planted in the spring they should have leaves by now. If they look dead they probably are dead. You can try to contact the catalog place or talk to the people at the home and garden store to see what they suggest. The best time to prune the trees are in early spring.

I have a dwarf Honeycrisp here in Michigan. It is about 9 years old. I've had two years where I had a great crop - both were years that I had a professional come in and spray several times in the season. I'd like to be able to care for this tree myself but just can't seem to gain any success. I use an organic balanced fertilizer; I spray with copper, milky spore, and a fruit tree insecticide; use the fake apples with Tangle-trap, and clean up all the bad apples under the tree, all to no avail.

what do i do with ground apples?

My wife and I just moved into an acrage with a old established apple orchard. We arent sure what kind of apples they are and will have to figure that out at some point. We just moved in and fall is coming early this year so there are a few thousand apples on the ground already and we've picked and froze thousands more. my issue is that we dont know what to do with all of the apples on the ground. many sites say to let them rot and fertilize the ground for future crops. but some say that if you do, it'll raise the chances that they will catch diseases easier. And that rodants will flock to your feilds to feed on them. so i'm not sure what the answer is. can you hekp me and answer it for me.

also, what is a good resource to use to figure out what kind of apples they are?

I live in my grandparents old house. There are 3 apple trees here that are at least 40 years old.

Thankyou for any help.

Could your grandfather have
reply
By Almanac Staff

Could your grandfather have meant that one of your tree was an "Arkansas Black" variety? You can find information about this cultivar on the Web.
 
As for the dimples and dark spots, that can be caused by several things. For example, apple scab causes brown corky areas and deformed fruit. Apple maggot flies lay eggs in the fruit, causing dimples (check for worms inside the apple, if so). Plum curculio also can lay eggs in the fruit and cause crescent shape marks and dimples. Tarnished plant bugs and codling moths can cause similar damage.
 
Small apples can be caused by poor pollination. We'd imagine that your grandfather planted the correct mix of varieties for proper cross-pollination, if needed (ones that are compatible and bloom around the same time). (Arkansas Black, for example, requires another variety for cross-pollination for best results.) However, sometimes the pollinators themselves may not do an adequate job, such as if the weather was unusually wet or cold. Insecticides may harm bee activity as well.
 
But more likely, the small fruit is due to poor thinning. Sometimes apples just produce too much fruit for all of them to grow large--the tree's energy is distributed too widely. It will naturally drop some of its fruit (around June) as a form of natural thinning. But one needs to also hand thin for best fruit size and tree health. Too much fruit can cause limbs to break, as well as "biennial bearing" which means that a sparse crop next year will follow a heavy crop this year. To avoid this, thin the crop each year. When the fruits are about dime size, thin out each cluster of fruit to 1 large, healthy looking fruit. Remove any diseased, wrinkled, malformed etc., apples. Space apples to about 6 to 8 inches between each. For more information, see:

Honeycrisp requires another
reply
By Almanac Staff

Honeycrisp requires another apple or crabapple variety for cross-pollination in order to produce fruit; most pear trees also require a compatible pear variety. However, the lack of blossoms suggest that something else is also going on. It likely is that  your trees are just too young yet to flower. Sometimes it takes 3 to 6 years (depending on variety) before they will start producing flowers and fruit. Other causes can be too much nitrogen fertilizer, which may contribute to leaf growth rather than blossoms or lack of enough sunlight. Make sure that the variety is suitable for your area: Apples and pears require a certain amount of cold to fruit; it you live in a warm climate, certain varieties will not flower. Improper pruning can also be a culprit.

Hi, Karen: You ask a simple question whose simple answer unfortunately is not too helpful -- It depends on what type (variety) of tree you have. Some are self-fruitful (can set fruit by themselves) and some require cross-pollination from another tree, usually by honeybees. If yours is in the second category, there is still hope for you if somehow bees from another near enough tree are able to find their way to yours. Thanks for asking!

That depends. Older trees
reply
By Almanac Staff

That depends. Older trees sometimes peel bark naturally. But pests, diseases, and cultural problems can also cause peeling bark. Check for holes or grooves in the bark and wood--borers (such as the flatheaded apple tree borer) sometimes lay eggs in bark; the larvae can chew and drill galleries in the underside of the bark, causing the bark to peel off in large patches. Other insects can also affect the bark. Sunscald can also cause peeling bark.

By Almanac Staff

Containers can be tricky to keep perfectly watered. They dry out quickly but can also get too soggy. You need to let the soil dry out between waterings and make sure that the wine barrel drains well. Most apple trees prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH range of 5.0 to 6.8. You may want to test the soil to make sure that the soil is not too acidic.

reply
By Almanac Staff

There are several considerations. Anna and Dorsett Golden are a perfect pair as to pollination, and they are both low-chill varieties. Granny Smith requires a bit more chill hours (about 400 to 500 hours vs. 200 to 300 for the others) to blossom, and is said to grow to Zone 8. We're not sure how it would do in your Zone 9, but it is certainly worth a try. As you stated, too, the seedlings grown from seed from a Granny Smith apple may not come true--so you may not get edible apples, and your trees may not perform the same as a true Granny Smith--as to chill hours, hardiness, bloom time, etc. Granny Smith tends to be a later season variety, ripening in Texas around September, whereas Anna and Dorsett Golden are more early season, ripening in late June/early July. It could be that your Granny Smith offspring might bloom too late to pollinate the others. For more information, you might ask the company where you bought your Anna and Dorsett Golden apple trees about pollination compatibility with Granny Smith. Or, try contacting your county's Cooperative Extension:

Old apple trees are good hosts for new grafts. Leave some healthy branches on the tree. The limbs can be any length but for best results their diameters should be 3/4” to 2” at the points where they’ll be cut off to receive the new scions. Best time to graft is just before the buds open in late winter or in early spring.

Yes! Old apple trees are worth saving--as long as the branches seem healthy and the trunk is not split or rotting. You'll need to prune the old trees in late winter or early spring before the leaves begin to appear.  Up to one-third of the live wood on an apple tree can be removed each year. If a tree has been abandoned for a long time, cut only diseased and damaged branches before removing one-third of the live wood. After pruning, be sure to clear out the area around the trees so that they can get sunlight and air circulation. See more about pruning trees above.

Apple trees grow well in a wide range of soil types. The soil needs to drain well, however, and not get soggy. They prefer soils with a texture of sandy loam to a sandy clay loam soil. Ideal soil pH for apple trees is near 6.5. You can usually get a free or low-cost soil test for your county cooperative extension. If your soil doesn't drain well, plant trees higher than they are planted in the nursery (2 to 4 inches higher). All the best!

reply

In order for those blossoms to become apples, you need 1) two or more apple tree varieties near each other so that they can pollinate and 2) bees which carry the pollen from one flower to another. You'll know if they are pollinated: If apple seeds develop, the petals from the blossoms will fall off. Next the fruit will start developing. So -- there must have been a nearby tree that is was blooming at the same time that yours bloomed last year?

By Apple Tree Fan in Wisconsin
Hi - We live in Madison, WI and this is our 3rd spring in this house. There's a mature, or seems to be a fairly mature, apple tree in our backyard (south-facing) that produced a beautiful crop of large honey-crisp type apples last year. (Even with the drought -- we watered it pretty regularly.) But it appears that there aren't going to be any apples on it this year (as was the case two seasons ago as well.) Is it common for some apple trees to only produce fruit every other year?? There is another apple tree in the back yard that has never produced more than a handful of apples that seems to have a few more apples forming this year. That one is a flowering apple tree whereas the main one that produced the great apples last year does not flower much at all but otherwise has a lot of new growth and looks healthy. (We pruned it a fair amount late late last Fall.) Any thoughts about the lack of apples?

reply

There could be a couple of reasons for the lack of fruit this year. Heavy pruning, where you remove a portion of a branch, will stimulate more vegetative growth and delay flowering.
A normal apple tree develops buds for next year at the same time it matures the fruit for the current crop. Last fall your tree may have used most of its energy to mature the many apples and formed less new buds for this years.
Late frosts in the spring can also damage the new flower buds.

reply
By Almanac Staff

There are many reasons why apples fall off the tree early. Often, it's due to lack of good pollination by bees. Also, apples must have cross-pollination in order to develop fruit; they cannot pollinate themselves or any flowers of the same apple variety. Plant at least two varieties of apple trees together in order to maximize fruit production and quality. Make sure that the varieties you choose have overlapping bloom dates.
Fertility is also influenced by good tree nutrition. Take soil tests and follow fertilization guidelines based on these tests; do not overfertilize. As a general rule, we apply 1 pound of 10-10-10 fertilizer to each tree the first year, 2 pounds the second year, and 3 pounds the third year up to a maximum of 5 to 6 pounds for a mature tree. Apply in late winter or early spring before growth begins--and do not apply to near the tree trunk.

By Rebecca G.
I have a red delicious apple tree and it is probably about a year old and a half old. I took a seed and refrigerated it with a damp paper towel which worked really well and it has been in a pot ever since. The tree is really thin and the leaves start about one and a half feet from the bottom. It is just over three feet now. I was just wondering how long I can keep my tree in a pot? I was not planning on keeping it in a pot for so long but I moved from OH to SC and now I live in an apartment so I am unable to plant it. Right now it is sitting on the balcony and seems to be doing really well. It dropped off its leaves in the winter and I thought it was dead but then it grew them back and has grown almost two feet since spring started. I won't be living in a house for another 6 to 8 months though. Will my tree survive until then? Also, it is siting in OH dirt right now and I have noticed that the dirt around here is a reddish color. Will the change in soil be a problem? Oh and should I water it in the winter? Sorry for all the questions, I have never grown a tree before but it is pretty exciting because I never expected my seeds to actually sprout in the refrigerator. It was more of an experiment than a plan.

Your tree will be fine in a container for another few months. You may have to repot it into a bigger pot. Fall and spring are the best times to transplant into the ground. Make sure the soil is well-drained and not too wet. Soil needs to be moderately rich and retain moisture as well as air. Add lots of compost to the planting hole. The tree goes dormant in the winter so there is no need to water it. Good luck with your "experiment"!

It's the only fruit-bearing tree in my yard (whenever I grow something I call it a "science experiment" so that I don't feel too guilty when it dies). This tree began coming full of fruit (about 20 little apples) last year, and this year the flowers are all over the tree! I've looked it up online to see if it's a McIntosh or crabapple, and the flowers look alike. Since I don't eat my science experiments, how do I find out if it's a McIntosh or a crabapple tree?

The bark is pretty strong but because of the winds I put in a stick so that it doesn't break. It has five small branches and a leaf appeared on it. It's been a couple of months since its had a leaf. But I didn't give up. Do you think that by the time summer comes around it will grow back its leaves? It also has what looks like two smaller apple trees starting to grow on the base of this tree.

apple tree vigor
reply
By Almanac Staff

Factors including growth habit (dwarf, semi-dwarf, or standard); cultivar; rootstock; environmental conditions (spacing, light, water, soil nutrients, winter/wind protection, etc.); care (such as proper pruning), pests/diseases, etc., will all affect the vigor and the number of years in which your apple trees will establish themselves fully and start to bear fruit.

Have your soil tested to make sure it is fertile enough for your young trees. Keep the area weeded. Make sure that the trees are getting enough sunlight and are not exposed to constant wind. Keep them watered during drought. It could also be that you have a rootstock or cultivar that encourages slower growth. If that is the case, everything is probably on track, but it may take several more years for the tree to fully establish. Pruning while the tree is dormant can help to stimulate growth in spring (keep in mind, though, that this can delay fruiting); in addition to the advice in the article above, ask a local nursery about how to prune young apple trees to increase vigor. Also, during the growing season, you can try bending a branch or two into a horizontal position for a few weeks, as described in the article above, to encourage branching.

New to Apple Trees
reply
By Almanac Staff

What's normal? Your first task should be to find out what kind of apple tree it is. Take a few of the apples and a few leaves to a local nursery and ask them for their best guess. Maybe you'll need to have someone come out and look at the tree to be sure. Based on that, you'll have a better idea of what's normal (presuming you mean apple color inside and out, etc.), and should be able to gather a lot more info about the care, pruning, eating, etc. For now, avoid the bug-infested or -bitten apples. Generally, apples are a shade of white inside (the flesh), so avoiding brown flesh seems like the right idea. You—not your children—might try a nibble of the white flesh of an otherwise healthy apple and see how it tastes. (You can spit it out instead of swallowing it, if you are especially concerned.) Even if the taste is—er—unappealing now, it could improve if the tree is given the appropriate care. That's best determined by finding out its type...so we're back to the beginning. Good luck!

Apple tree shock??

I recently planted 2 apple and 2 peach trees from orchard stock. My Honey Crisp is not looking so good, it is very wilted. Any suggestions? Is there a way to help this tree if it is shock?

If this is transplant shock, make sure that it is getting enough water. Water deeply so that it reaches the entire root system (which can extend beyond the branches)—but don’t water so that the soil is soggy (an inch per week is usually good, but monitor closely). Water regularly and add mulch to conserve water and prevent weeds. Do not prune the tree at this time, except for damaged branches. As for other causes of wilting, was the plant rootbound (roots dense and circling around each other) when you planted the tree? Was it planted at the recommended depth? In the recommended soil (loose, not compact)? Does it have enough light? Do you see any spots on the leaves, or signs of pests? If you obtained the tree from a nursery, you might ask for their recommendation; if the plant doesn’t make it, it could be that it is under warranty and they can send you a replacement.

Planting crab apples

I'm looking to plant a few crab apples for deer attraction. My plan us to grow the trees in buckets until large enough to plant in the woods with out fear of animals eating the sapling. How deep to plant the seeds and any pointers to ensure the seed will sprout?

The seed needs cold to germinate; if you are in a cold climate (winter temperatures below 40F), the seed will be OK if you plant in the fall. If your area doesn’t get that cold, then you probably need to stratify the seed before planting; place the seed in a sealed plastic bag filled with a mix of lightly moistened (not wet) peat moss in the refrigerator for 60 to 120 days and then plant. When you are ready to plant, sow the seed at a depth of about 1/2 to 1 inch. Most crabapple cultivars are budded or grafted; you will not get the same plant if you use seed from fruit of these cultivars (however, it could be that the fruit still might be tasty to deer). Crab apples like full sun (at least 8 hours each day), so be sure when you are transplanting them in the woods, that you select a sunny spot.

Crab Apple Tree or Apple Tree

I have purchased a home which has a great big Apple Tree. The Tree was neglected and overgrown. I pruned it a lot in the Spring and it Blossemed nicely and has started to produce little crab apples. My neighbor seems to think it used to be a Real Apple tree. If I keep up with the Pruning and care is there a chance it could be an apple tree jsut producing crab apples due to neglect?

Crab apples are a type of tree and there are many varieties (e.g., Bailey's, Monrovia, and Jackson and Perkins). They won't turn into an "Apple" tree. Apples and crabapples will pollinate each other. And you can still use the fruit of a crab apple in cooking (applesauce, jelly)! You prune the tree in early spring before it blooms or leafs out. Follow our instructions above for tree care. You may wish to bring a sample to a nearby tree nursery for identification.

Hi! I have 2 apple trees and a pear tree. We have lived here for 5 yrs and never ate an apple because I heard you can't just wash and eat them. I hate that these apples are going to waste. Do you know if you can just pick and eat off established apple trees? or must they be treated with a chemical spray of some sort? Thank you.

An organic apple is perfectly fine to eat! It's the apple trees that are sprayed with pesticides which are of concern.

why doesn't my McIntosh apple tree bare full size apples

I grew a McIntosh from a seed and now the tree is about 30 feet tall but only bares small apples about the size of marbles or a little bigger..can anyone tell me what to do to get them to grow to full size?

We'd suggest that you hand thin the tree in late May. There are also fruit-thinning sprays. At this stage, you could take some hand pruners and very gently remove some smaller apples to allow the energy to go into developing bigger apples. It's hard to remove the little apples, but you have to do it!

If you grew an apple tree from a seed out of a McIntosh apple it won't produce McIntosh apples, because the seed is a cross btwn the McIntosh flower (female) and the apple tree that produced the pollen that fertilized the flower (male). Even if the pollen producer is a McIntosh, the seed won't produce a McIntosh due to genetics. To get a McIntosh apple you need to clone it by grafting a McIntosh scion onto an suitable apple rootstock, like the one you grew.

thinning apples
reply
By Anonymous
I just bought a gala & McIntosh tree (fo planting in norther VT), each about 3 to 3-1/2 inch caliper. My supplier said I should thin the apples to only about 12 per tree to help the roots get better established. Is this true? If I thin so no branch gets overloaded and no apples are closer than 4 inches to each other, can I "safely" grow moe than a dozen this season?

Thanks for any advice.

Yes, apples should be thinned
reply
By Almanac Staff

Yes, apples should be thinned for good fruit size and encourage bloom next year. It may seem extreme but it really does produce a higher-quality tree and crop. Cut off enough fruit so that your remaining apples are spaced 4 to 6 inches apart and you leave 1 fruit per bloom cluster (which is generally 5 to 6 blossoms ). You should think the apples when they are about the size of a dime.

I heard you should not eat apples from a tree in the first or second year? Is this true? We just planted a couple of Honey Crisp Apple trees and they are getting apples. DARE we NOT eat the fruit?

Hmmm...We haven't heard this. In fact, we'd encourage you to pick the apples in the first year after planting to help the tree produce more fruit next year. However, after the first year, thin fruit so it doesn't get overloaded and produces better quality. Also, Honey Crisps can be a tease! Make sure the fruit is truly ripe (all red) before picking. Taste one and you'll see.
