Packaged Oatmeal with Apples

Apples are the #1 food on the 2014 Dirty Dozen list. Of course, you don’t have to worry about the pesticides if you buy organic apples, but watch out for apples and apple food products that don’t specify being made with organic apples. Instant oatmeal products made with apples are included; buy it with organic ingredients or make your own using fresh, organic fruit.
